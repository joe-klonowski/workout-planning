- Identify and visually distinguish between workouts from Friel vs tri club vs other.
- Allow user to schedule workouts for a time of day (e.g. "morning" or "7am").
  - Probably this will require creating separate fields for:
    - When the coach originally planned the workout (DateOnly datatype).
    - When the athlete is planning to do the workout (can be something general like "Tuesday" or "Tuesday morning" or something more specific like "Tuesday 7am")
- Allow user to move workouts to a different day and different time of day.
- Allow user to pick and choose which workouts they're going to plan to do or not do.
  - Temporarily hide workouts the user isn't planning to do.
  - Summarize how much the user is planning to do each week.
- Save changes to server/DB/backend so that calendar can be saved and accessed across devices.
- Export to other platforms such as Garmin Connect or Hammerhead.
- Create separate documentation files for users and developers (currently this is all grouped together in README.md).
