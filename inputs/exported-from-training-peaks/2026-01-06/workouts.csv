"Swim Tech 305 - Recovery Endurance Swim (Pace)","Swim","RECOVERY ENDURANCE SWIM This workout is essential after long weeks of pushing our bodies with speed, strength and endurance work. Essentially, this is a shakeout workout to stay loose and refreshed for most of the yardage, but then add in short fast efforts here and there. During the 100s, stay just below your threshold ""race pace"" with just slightly higher/quicker turnover rate (increase strokes per minute by ~2-3 spm if you can). During the straight sets, try to swim as efficiently as possible, counting your strokes to lower your STROKE COUNT (strokes per 25yds) swimming with more of a ""catch-up"" style ""gliding"" swim stroke. CATCH UP VIDEO example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPOZidhYrlw - straight 70% swims on 15-20 sec rest - sets of 3 x 100's @ 1:15-1:45/100 or set an interval which gives very short :05-15s seconds rest to stay around 80-90% of your Max heart rate. ==== WARM UP 200 swim/ 100 kick/ 100 pull MAIN SET 300 @ 70% w/ 15s R.I. 3 x 100 @ below ""race pace"" w/ 5s RI 250 @ 70% 3 x 100 150 @ 70% 3 x 100 100 @ 70% 3 x 100 200 WD 2,600 total yards","0.614722222222222","2377.43994140625","2026-01-05","","2308.86006164551","","","","","0.510277777777778","1.19197731628576","","26","","148","167","","","1.07212850058704","62.89","12","15","5","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"4Star Bike ""Sweet Spot"" Sub-Threshold 5x5min 90% 60min (PWR) 4S","Bike","""SWEET SPOT"" (5x5min @ 90%) Hit some higher intensity (Z3-4 average) intervals, focusing on your ""sweet spot"" for endurance racing by averaging 80-90% of your threshold power for 5min at a time. The 3min recovery should feel like a near-complete recovery so your HR and POWER should stay consistent through this entire set. If you are struggling to keep cadence up, aim for 80% instead of 90%.

"Triathlete: As you get started...","Other","Thank you for using my training plan. To help you get the most from it, here are a few suggestions and explanations. Feel free to follow up with an email if you are confused (joe@joefrieltraining.com). 1. The daily workouts may be rearranged to better suit your lifestyle. While I've arranged them each day in an order that is usually best, it may not suit your unique situation. 2. Common abbreviations used in this plan: Swim: WU=warm-up, MS=main set, CD=cool down. Strength: RM=repetition max (heaviest load you can lift one time for a given exercise—see Training Bible for strength session details on AA, MT, MS, and SM workouts). Other: HR=heart rate, FTP=functional threshold power, FTHR=functional threshold heart rate, FTPa=functional threshold pace 3. If you have questions about other terms used here, see my Triathlete's Training Bible Glossary for explanations. You may also check out my website (https://joefrieltraining.com/) for details on training methods. Use the ""Search"" function. 4. Workouts are also explained in my Triathlete's Training Bible in Appendixes B, C, D, and E. 5. At the end of this plan you may purchase another that takes up where this one leaves off by going to https://www.trainingpeaks.com/coach/joe-friel#trainingplans. 6. I really want to see you succeed with your event goal and I'd like to hear how this plan worked out for you. Please drop me a short email and let me know how you did and what you thought of this plan. Good luck!

"SS1. 5 Basic Strides 45min RPE","Run","(This is best outdoors but may be done on a treadmill.) Warm up for about 20 minutes. Then run 5x20 seconds fast on a soft, gentle downhill (such as on grass in a park or other soft surface). Run at approximately 400m race pace (RPE 9, or about pace zone 5b)—not quite all-out speed. Focus on run technique as discussed and shown in the drawings in Chapter 12 of The Triathlete’s Training Bible, 4th edition. Hold back a little on each 20-second stride. You’re working on technique—not speed. Stay relaxed on each stride. Walk (yes, ""walk"") back to start point for each recovery. Run easily to cool down to complete the planned workout duration. Note that this workout uses RPE due to the very short intervals and walking recoveries.","0.75","","2026-01-06","Note that the daily workouts are in no particular order.
