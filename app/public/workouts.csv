"Triathlete: As you get started...","Other","Thank you for using my training plan. To help you get the most from it, here are a few suggestions and explanations. Feel free to follow up with an email if you are confused (joe@joefrieltraining.com). 1. The daily workouts may be rearranged to better suit your lifestyle. While I've arranged them each day in an order that is usually best, it may not suit your unique situation. 2. Common abbreviations used in this plan: Swim: WU=warm-up, MS=main set, CD=cool down. Strength: RM=repetition max (heaviest load you can lift one time for a given exercise—see Training Bible for strength session details on AA, MT, MS, and SM workouts). Other: HR=heart rate, FTP=functional threshold power, FTHR=functional threshold heart rate, FTPa=functional threshold pace 3. If you have questions about other terms used here, see my Triathlete's Training Bible Glossary for explanations. You may also check out my website (https://joefrieltraining.com/) for details on training methods. Use the ""Search"" function. 4. Workouts are also explained in my Triathlete's Training Bible in Appendixes B, C, D, and E. 5. At the end of this plan you may purchase another that takes up where this one leaves off by going to https://www.trainingpeaks.com/coach/joe-friel#trainingplans. 6.

"T2. Functional Threshold Test 1h (20min) HR+Pace","Run","The purpose of this test is to determine your Functional Threshold Pace (FTPa) and Functional Threshold Heart Rate (FTHR) for running in order to set your training zones. Following a few days of active rest and recovery you should be ready for a hard, racelike effort. (If not feeling ready for this test then omit it and instead do what will help you be ready for testing tomorrow.) For this test a road course should be relatively flat or you may do it on a track (preferred). Use the same course every time in the future you do this test. (Unfortunately, most treadmills can’t be calibrated closely enough for the pacing accuracy required of this test, but they may be used for FTHR measurement.) Warm up for this test for at least 15 minutes. Then start the test as if you are in a race that lasts 20 minutes. (You may also substitute a 5km race for this test if your time is likely to be 18 to 22 minutes.) Hold back slightly in the first 5 minutes (most athletes start much too fast). Every 5 minutes decide whether you should go slightly faster or slower for the next 5 minutes. Afterwards cool down with easy jogging and walking. Following the workout find your average heart rate for the 20-minute test. Subtract 5 percent and you have an estimate of your run FTHR. Then use Table 4.1 (The Triathlete’s Training Bible, 5th edition) to compute your heart rate training zones. If using a GPS device on a road course, to determine FT Pace add 5 percent to your Normalized Graded Pace. If the test was done on a track use the track’s measurement of distance covered to determine pace and also add 5 percent for an estimate of FT Pace. Table 4.1 (Training Bible, 5th edition) may then be used to set your pace training zones.","1","","2026-03-28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It should be mostly flat or slightly uphill (2-3% grade). Maintain the highest speed/power possible for the entire 20 minutes. Finish with a short cool down spin in power zone 1. Your 5-minute average power is an indication of your VO2max power. Record your average heart rate and normalized power (NP) for the 20-minute TT. Multiply your 20-minute NP (and average HR) by 0.95 to determine your FTP (and FTHR). Zones may be set up for the bike (heart rate and/or power) by using these final numbers. For a more detailed explanation of how to set zones go to Chapter 4 in The Triathlete’s Training Bible, 5th edition. This test may also be done on an indoor trainer, but the numbers are likely to be lower than what you’d get on the road.","1.5","","2026-03-29","For the 20-minute test, decide at the end of every 5 minutes if you will increase, keep the same, or decrease power for the next 5 minutes. Warning: Most athletes start much too fast.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
